* =asm=, the assembler for TinyCPU
An example program is reproduced below:
#+begin_src txt
  load_arr_0:
          LDI array          # An interesting note about the design of labels in
          LDI array          # the assembler is that doing this lets me load a pointer.
          SWAB
          SWMB               # rM now has &(array[0]).
          LDM                # Should have array[0] == 42 in rA

  halt:
          JU halt

  array:
          .word 42
#+end_src
