* =emu=, the TinyCPU Emulator

=emu= is a Python program that emulates the TinyCPU processor. It is
instruction-accurate, and prints a log of the processor register file
after each instruction to =stdout=.

** Usage
#+begin_src sh
  emu binary_file
#+end_src

=binary_file= is generally expected to be one generated by =asm=, the
TinyCPU assembler.


** Future Features
Most of these future features make the command line interface of =emu=
unstable, since it is already used in multiple run scripts for
comparison with RTL simulations.
- Add a =--verbose= option that switches on the logfile printing.
- Add a =-o= option that can specify a logfile path.
